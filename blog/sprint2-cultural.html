                    <h3>LONG TERM GOAL</h3>
                    <p>Over the past 8 years I’ve worked in the services industry, mostly in sales and customer service.  It’s helped me to gain good interpersonal skills which I believe will assist me in reaching an overall career commitment.  At this stage, I know that I want to be a programmer but long term, I am uncertain.  I like the idea of DevOps, Product Owner or in general a leader in tech.  I think that some of the experiences through EDA will help me to realise what this may be but for now, my BFHG is to become a JavaScript programmer.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT NON-TECHNICAL SKILLS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPED WITH EDA?</h3>
                    <p>I would like to learn more about time management and overcoming imposter syndrome.  I often have that inner voice that creeps into your mind and tells me I’m not good enough.  Some tools to overcome this would be awesome.</p>

                    <h2>STRENGTHS</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Empathy.  I try to understand other perspectives as much as possible.  It has helped me to build relationships in the past.</li>
                        <li>Resilience.  I work hard to overcome obstacles and reach an end point.</li>                        
                        <li>Honesty.  I try my best to tell the truth, even if it will get myself into trouble.</li>
                        <li>Communication. I’m good with people and not afraid of having a conversation.</li>
                        <li>Fun.  I love laughing!</li>

                    <h2>LIMITATIONS</h2>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Asking for help.  I struggle with asking for help sometimes because I am afraid of judgement.</li>
                        <li>Indecisiveness.  I can get caught up in the details of a situation which can prevent me from making decisions.</li>
                        <li>Saying yes too much.  I’ll commit to help someone purely out of politeness rather than actually looking at my calendar to check my availability.</li>
                        <li>Fear of failure.  This has often stopped me from giving something a go.</li>

                    <h3>HOW WILL YOU OVERCOME YOUR LIMITATIONS?</h3>
                    <p>I pledge to ask for help either to my cohort members or facilitators after I have searched on Google and StackOverflow in a timely manner.  I will also break down sprints into manageable timeframes and stop listening to the inner voice that tells me I'm not going to make it.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM THE FACILITATION TEAM?</h3>
                    <p>I expect to be treated fairly and with honesty.  I want to be better on a personal and professional level, the only way I can do that is by knowing and understanding myself.  So, if I'm not dilivering or I'm not doing to something right, I want to be told so I can improve. Lastly, I gave up a career and a life to be here in this course, as I'm sure a lot of other people have, so the main thing is support.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT IS YOUR LONG-TERM GOAL AND/OR CAREER PATHWAY?</h3>
                    <p>My end goal from EDA is to finish with the skills that will enable me to gain employment as a full stack developer.  I would like to use these skills in order to add value to the culture and technical performance of a company which aligns with what I am passionate about, helping people. In terms of my career path, I would like to continue growing my skills in order to reach a position as a software developer.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR BIGGEST STRENGTHS AND LIMITATIONS WILL BE IN BOOTCAMP?</h3>
                    <p>Originally, I thought that I would have some good technical abilities before going in but now I realize now that I currently lack the technical depth and problem-solving abilities that would assist me in becoming a good full stack developer.  I also noticed I need to seriously improve on my organizational skills, create some better habits and practice discipline.  This is something I will need to improve on and will hopefully get better with time.  I also struggle with asking for help, I’m not a big fan of the spotlight and attention.  This is also something I also need to get over.</p>
                    <p>I still believe I have good communicative and empathetic abilities which enables me to build good relationships.  I never give up until a conclusion is met and will work hard to achieve results.  I realized that I am quite detailed, which can be a positive and a negative.  I focus on making things look good before they are committed, this includes making my code look organized before commits.  I also am a sucker for consistent indentation, name schemes and avoiding deep nesting.</p>
                    <p>I will do my absolute best to not let my limitations hinder anyone else’s progress.  If I am proving to be an obstacle, I would like to be told so I can work towards bettering myself.</p>

                    <h3>WHAT DO YOU THINK YOUR BIGGEST NON-TECHNICAL CHALLENGE AT BOOTCAMP WILL BE?</h3>
                    <p>I think that my biggest non-technical challenge will be discipline with staying on task 100% of the time and secondly my organizational skills in general.  I believe it will help me, not only in my professional life but also my personal life as well.  I would also like to mention speaking in front of a group – I’m not a huge fan of the spotlight.</p>

                    <p>In order for me to have a successful experience with EDA I can’t stress enough how much I want the Bootcamp team to be 100% honest with me.  In order to be a full stack developer, I need to know what I need to improve on, even at the risk of offending.  Other than that, just being there to help at the appropriate time.</p>

                    <p>I declare that I will endeavor to seek a solution to problem via Google, Stack Overflow or various online platforms first, secondly through my cohort and lastly through my facilitators in a timely manner which will not impede my own or anyone else’s learning experience.  I would like to take as much away from EDA as I possibly can in order to reach my goals.</p>
