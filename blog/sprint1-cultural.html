                    <h2>CORE VALUES</h2>
                    <p>
                        I consider myself lucky to have grown up in Aotearoa New Zealand along-side people who are unmeasurably supportive. I’m grateful for the circumstances in my life and the events that have shaped me to be the person I am.
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I try to be empathetic, honest and reliable. I have enthusiasm, a thirst for learning and I try to undertake new challenges with maturity and focus.  My work ethic is something I pride myself in and I’m always happy to help other people.
                    </p>

                    <h3>AN INTERESTING NARRATIVE</h3>
                    <p>
                        This may sound corny but I’ve always prided my ability to ignore the inside voice that tells me “this will benefit me” as opposed to the voice that says, “what’s the right thing to do?”...
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        I remember when I was selling cars, a lady walked into our dealership who was in need of a new vehicle.  
                        She reeked of alcohol and was having trouble staying on task.  She announced the car she would like to buy and explained that she would need finance. 
                        So, I thought rather than rejecting this person straight away, I would introduce her to a manager, and they could decline them.  
                    </p>
                    <p>
                        She ended up taking a car away for a test drive with two friends who came in slightly after to drive the car for her.   
                        When they left for the drive, the manager came up to me and explained that the person had been convicted for a DUI twice and her license was currently expunged – hence the two friends driving the car. 
                        This forced me to ask myself a difficult question.  “Would I be ok with selling a car, to someone who could be under the influence, potentially hurt themselves, end up going to jail because of it or worse, hurting people?  
                        I explained to my manager, that I could not be the one responsible for selling this person a vehicle.  
                        My manager explained “Seb, you have to move ethics aside and sell this person a car”. Needless to say, I didn’t, and that day I decided sales was a means to an end.
                    </p>

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Empathy.  I try to understand other perspectives as much as possible.  It has helped me to build relationships in the past.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Resilience.  I work hard to overcome obstacles and reach an end point.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Honesty.  I try my best to tell the truth, even if it will get myself into trouble. 
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Communication. I’m good with people and not afraid of having a conversation.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fun.  I love laughing!

                    <ul>
                        <li>
                            Asking for help.  I struggle with asking for help sometimes because I am afraid of judgement.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Indecisiveness.  I can get caught up in the details of a situation which can prevent me from making decisions.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Saying yes too much.  I’ll commit to help someone purely out of politeness rather than actually looking at my calendar to check my availability.
                        </li>
                        <li>
                            Fear of failure.  This has often stopped me from giving something a go. 
                        </li>
