            <p>Firstly, it would be prudent to disclose that there is still a lot of research to be done to understand the intricacies of Neuroplasticity but what we currently know is that earlier, more traditional theories on brain development may not be entirely accurate.  It was traditionally thought that after certain age or maturity, the human brain’s efficiency to log new information or learn more would decrease with age.  Contrary to this, Neuroplasticity describes a brain’s ability to form new connections, pathways and change “the wiring” so as to continue to develop your brain.  It’s similar to muscle memory in that the more we practice the more familiar we get.  Research has shown that even the “thought” itself can have a major impact on the improvement of the activities that we undertake.  Through continuous stimulation, our brain is able to expand our neural pathways and process more information.</p>

      <h2>GROWTH MINDSET</h2>

      <section class="boxStyle">
        <div class="textAlign">
            <p>In addition to the power of thought, a psychologist form Stanford University, Dr Carol Dweck, explains a great metaphor regarding this.  Dweck explains that some education systems are now adopting a new method called “the theory of yet”.  Instead of awarding students a mark of fail or not achieved, they would be given a mark of “not yet”.  The idea behind this is change the thought process in which we address learning.  Evidence shows that students who are failed are more likely to cheat, offload personal responsibility and worse, give up entirely.  But! The “not yet” approach left students realising they are on a learning curve.  If given the time, they could achieve the results to succeed.</p>
