                <h3>LONG TERM GOAL</h3>
                <p>Over the past 8 years I’ve worked in the services industry, mostly in sales and customer service.  It’s helped me to gain good interpersonal skills which I believe will assist me in reaching an overall career commitment.  At this stage, I know that I want to be a programmer but long term, I am uncertain.  I like the idea of DevOps, Product Owner or in general a leader in tech.  I think that some of the experiences through EDA will help me to realise what this may be but for now, my BFHG is to become a JavaScript programmer.</p>
                <h3>WHAT NON-TECHNICAL SKILLS WOULD YOU LIKE TO SEE DEVELOPED WITH EDA?</h3>
                <p>I would like to learn more about time management and overcoming imposter syndrome.  I often have that inner voice that creeps into your mind and tells me I’m not good enough.  Some tools to overcome this would be awesome.</p>
                <h3>HOW WILL YOU OVERCOME YOUR LIMITATIONS?</h3>
                <p>I pledge to ask for help either to my cohort members or facilitators after I have searched on Google and StackOverflow in a timely manner.  I will also break down sprints into manageable timeframes and stop listening to the inner voice that tells me I'm not going to make it.</p>
                <h3>WHAT DO YOU EXPECT FROM THE FACILITATION TEAM?</h3>
                <p>I expect to be treated fairly and with honesty.  I want to be better on a personal and professional level, the only way I can do that is by knowing and understanding myself.  So, if I'm not dilivering or I'm not doing to something right, I want to be told so I can improve. Lastly, I gave up a career and a life to be here in this course, as I'm sure a lot of other people have, so the main thing is support.</p>
