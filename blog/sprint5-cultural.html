                <h3>WHAT IS THE ROLE OF VALUES, EMPATHY AND SELF-AWARENESS IN LEARNING AND PROGRAMMING?</h3>
                <p>I think that the main purpose of empathy and self-awareness is to learn how to manage the inner critic and how we critique others.</p>
                <p>Empathy is so important because it helps us to communicate effectively and solve problems in a productive manner.  If I understand another person’s perspective then firstly, this person is more inclined to listen to me and secondly, I’m more inclined to listen to them in order to reach an endpoint.  It’s a win/win scenario.</p>
                <p>Self-awareness is equally important because it means we can learn how to reflect on our actual situation rather than assuming a negative standpoint.  This enables us to assess what next steps we need to take in order to better ourselves. Who doesn’t want that?</p>

                <h3>WHAT SURPRISED YOU THE MOST ABOUT THE CORE LEARNING</h3>
                <p>I learned a lot about my strengths and weaknesses.  It gave me to really good tools in how to manage my imposter syndrome.</p>

                <h3>WHAT WERE THE MOST CHALLENGING ASPECTS OF THE CORE LEARNING?</h3>
                <p>Sometimes reflection can be difficult because it forces us to ask questions about ourselves that can be confronting.  It forces us to look at our insecurities.  I found that writing about myself is also a difficult task.  There were times when I would just stare at my monitor with a blank expression on my face.</p>

                <h3>WHY DO YOU THINK WE, A PROGRAMMING SCHOOL, ARE SPENDING SO MUCH TIME FOCUSING ON CORE LEARNING IN A WEB DEVELOPMENT BOOTCAMP COURSE?</h3>
                <p>I think that there is a number of reasons.  Empathy and self-awareness in the tech sector specifically in the development and programming sector isn’t common.  This adds to why tech employers are looking for people with skills in this area.  People with these skills are more likely to integrate into team cultures, they have good communication skills and learn to put their ego aside in order to solve a problem.  It’s worth more than someone with the best craft skills.</p>

                <h3>DOES THE TIME YOU SPEND STUDYING CORE LEARNING HERE FEEL LIKE A WASTE OF TIME?</h3>
                <p>No, I don’t think these skills are a waste of time at all!  I understand the importance of being able to apply the core skills.  I would like to spend more time on JavaScript learning but this isn’t specific to the content in Core Learning.</p>
