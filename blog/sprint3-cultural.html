                <h3>WHAT IS EMOTIONAL INTELLIGENCE?</h3>
                <div class="textAlign">
                    <p>Google defines Emotional Intelligence or the Emotional Quotient (EQ) as the capacity to be aware of, control, and express one’s emotions, and to handle interpersonal relationships judiciously with empathy.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>HOW IS IT DIFFERENT FROM IQ?</h3>
                <div class="textAlign">
                    <p>Emotional Intelligence is an integral part of what we need in order to be successful in our professional and personal lives.  IQ is a score derived from a set of tests designed to assess an individual’s intelligence.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>WHY IS IT IMPORTANT?</h3>
                <div class="textAlign">
                    <p>I think that they are both important in that IQ still has a place.  However, it is more so important in today’s modern age to understand, empathise and communicate effectively with other people.  We live in a world of instant gratification whereby the need to leave our home is least it’s ever been.  Society has, in some sense, underestimated the effects of technology in society itself and so the need for us as a collective to understand and communicate with one another is more important than ever before.  Applying Emotional Intelligence maximises the chances of successful relationships both in personal and professional environments and assists in development of overall productivity.</p>
                    <p>One of the most important lessons from sales was to never assume.  People have an unmeasurable quantity of variables affecting their circumstances.  It’s important to understand that you or anyone might not know about what t those variables are but if one can learn to empathise and communicate you may see what lays beneath the tip of the iceberg and resolve the problem.</p>
